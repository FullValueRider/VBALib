'1. Do not use ParamArray:  Replace all uses of paramarray with a call to SeqC constructor except in the creation of SeqC and in SeqC methods

'2. Rewrote IMapper methods to take a whole SeqC rather than just one item at a time.


'ToDo List

'# KvpC
'
'- Implement initialisation with data?
'  Probably needs to wait until auto key is reestablished

'SeqA
'
'- Implement the external array binding stuff.  Do this only for injected arrays
'
'#SeqTesting
'
'- Add testing for MappedIt, Mapit, FilterIt, CountIt, ReduceIt


'# Sequences
'# Align code across seq

'# Kvp
'- Align code across KVP
